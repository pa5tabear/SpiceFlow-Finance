1. **Open SOL-KY-03** - Extract key terms: annual rent, escalators, lease duration
2. **Open Lanceleaf Solar** - Verify it's an executed lease, extract financial terms
3. **Scan 8568.pdf** - Determine if solar-related and worth detailed analysis

### Phase 2: Term Extraction (Sprint 1 completion)
- Create comparison table of lease terms from top 2 documents
- Identify commonalities in structure, payment terms, escalators
- Document any percentage rent or revenue-sharing clauses

### Phase 3: Model Building (Sprint 2)
- Use extracted terms to build Excel calculator
- Test calculator against actual lease examples
- Validate against industry standards (Renewa 12.5x model)

## Expected Value for Buyout Model
- **SOL-KY-03**: Real Kentucky solar lease terms for validation
- **Lanceleaf**: Potential second data point for comparison
