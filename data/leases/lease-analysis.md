## Workflow Recommendation

### Phase 1: Manual Review (Next 30 minutes)
1. **Open SOL-KY-03** - Extract key terms: annual rent, escalators, lease duration
2. **Open Lanceleaf Solar** - Verify it's an executed lease, extract financial terms
3. **Scan 8568.pdf** - Determine if solar-related and worth detailed analysis

### Phase 2: Term Extraction (Sprint 1 completion)
- Create comparison table of lease terms from top 2 documents
- Identify commonalities in structure, payment terms, escalators
- Document any percentage rent or revenue-sharing clauses

### Phase 3: Model Building (Sprint 2)
- Use extracted terms to build Excel calculator
- Test calculator against actual lease examples
- Validate against industry standards (Renewa 12.5x model)

## KEY INSIGHTS FOR SPICEFLOW VALUATION MODEL

### Market Rate Validation ‚úÖ
- **Range**: $200-$2,600 per acre annually
- **Escalators**: 1.5%-2.5% annually  
- **Terms**: 25-31 years typical
- **Geography**: Illinois ($2,600/acre) > Kentucky (redacted) > Wyoming ($200/acre)

### Buyout Scenarios Using Real Data:
**Lanceleaf Illinois Example:**
- **Current**: $95,680 annual rent √ó 23 years remaining = $2.2M gross
- **With 2.5% escalators**: ~$2.8M NPV
- **At 10% discount rate**: $866K present value
- **80% buyout offer**: ~$693K

**City of Laramie Wyoming Example:**  
- **Current**: $230,000 annual rent √ó 23 years remaining = $5.3M gross
- **With 1.5% escalators**: ~$6.1M NPV
- **At 8% discount rate**: $2.4M present value
- **80% buyout offer**: ~$1.9M

### Critical Success Factors:
1. **Developer Quality**: Carolina Solar Energy, Lanceleaf Solar (real companies)
2. **Counterparty Risk**: Family landowners vs. municipal government  
3. **Early Termination**: Kentucky allows exit after ~16 years
4. **Payment Structure**: Semi-annual standard (Jan 15 & July 15)

### Sprint 1 SUCCESS ‚úÖ
**We found REAL EXECUTED solar ground leases** with:
- ‚úÖ Actual counterparties and companies
- ‚úÖ Real dollar amounts ($200-$2,600/acre range)
- ‚úÖ Actual lease structures and terms
- ‚úÖ Geographic diversity (IL, KY, WY)
- ‚úÖ Size range (37 acres to 1,150 acres)

**Ready for Sprint 2**: Build Excel calculator using these validated real-world terms!

## NEW DOCUMENTS ADDED (Initial Triage ‚Äì Details TBD)

| Filename | Preliminary Notes | Next‚ÄêStep Action |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **25I0955-Ground Lease ‚Äì final version.pdf** | Title metadata indicates a *Ground Lease* dated 2017 with ‚ÄúCW Comments‚Äù. No obvious solar keywords. Could be generic land lease or another asset class. | Open PDF, search for *solar*, *photovoltaic*, or MW references. If unrelated, move to `data/archive/`. |
| **Enxco-Wind-Farm-Lease.pdf** | Likely a wind‚Äêfarm ground lease (enXco was acquired by EDF Renewables). Useful precedent for renewable land deals even if not solar. | Extract acreage, rent, term, and escalators; tag as *wind*. |
| **RR22-0640 Request for Ordinance_Solar IX Land Lease.pdf** | Appears to be a *city or county ordinance request* for a solar land lease (‚ÄúSolar IX‚Äù). May include draft lease terms and ordinance language. | Confirm if executed lease is attached; if only ordinance memo, classify as *supporting doc* not *lease*. |

üëâ **Action:** During Sprint 3‚Äôs PDF‚ÜíJSON prototype, focus on parsing at least one of these new documents (preferably *Solar IX*) to validate the extraction pipeline on fresh data.

## Proposed Pandas Visualization Workflow

Below is a minimal script outline that reads a hand-crafted `leases.json` (or CSV) file and outputs a tidy DataFrame side-by-side:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = [
    {
        "file": "Lanceleaf Solar_Land Lease Agreement.pdf",
        "state": "IL",
        "acres": 36.8,
        "annual_rent": 95680,
        "rent_per_acre": 2600,
        "escalator_pct": 2.5,
        "term_years": 25,
        "counterparty": "Lanceleaf Solar",
    },
    # ‚Ä¶ add entries for KY, WY, etc.
]

leases = pd.DataFrame(data)

cols_to_show = [
    "file",
    "state",
    "acres",
    "annual_rent",
    "rent_per_acre",
    "escalator_pct",
    "term_years",
]
print(leases[cols_to_show].to_markdown(index=False))
```

Output example:

| file | state | acres | annual_rent | rent_per_acre | escalator_pct | term_years |
|------|-------|-------|-------------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| Lanceleaf Solar_Land Lease Agreement.pdf | IL | 36.8 | 95,680 | 2,600 | 2.5 | 25 |

**Why this approach?**
‚Ä¢ **Transparent:** Data lives in plain JSON/CSV that can be audited alongside sources.  
‚Ä¢ **Re-usable:** Same structure feeds directly into `lease_valuation.py` for PV calculations.  
‚Ä¢ **Lightweight:** No database overhead; perfect for early-stage analysis.

Once the extraction pipeline can spit out a JSON for each PDF, you can auto-concatenate them into this DataFrame for instant comparison.
