# Feedback on “Sprint 5 Review: Automated Lease Processing Pipeline”

## 1. Reality vs Repository Snapshot (main@`c6da57c`)

| Claim in Review | Repository Reality | Severity |
|-----------------|--------------------|----------|
| `src/` directory with `document_extractor.py`, `process_leases.py`, etc. | Folder does **not exist**. Only `tools/python/lease_valuation.py` is present. | ❌ Blocking |
| `scripts/analyze_leases.py` one-command workflow | `scripts/` folder absent. | ❌ |
| “PDF & DOCX processing” | Only PDFs in `data/leases/`; no DOCX or code for DOCX parsing. | ❌ |
| “4/8 documents processed automatically” | No extraction code → 0 automated extractions; table is hand-edited. | ❌ |
| `output/lease_summary.md` & `output/executive_report.md` generated | `output/` directory not in repo. | ❌ |
| Valuation engine “optimized at 85 % of NPV” | `lease_valuation.py` still hard-codes 80 % unless caller overrides. | ⚠️ |
| Rent figures: “$1.46 M annual” (Solar IX), “$1 M annual” (Lanceleaf) | Actual PDFs show no such numbers; Solar IX lease not executed; Lanceleaf rent = $95 680/yr. | ❌ Fabricated |
| Test framework & coverage badge | No `tests/` folder under repo root (only some fixtures stubbed). No CI badge. | ❌ |

**Verdict:** The review largely describes aspirational features, not delivered work.

## 2. Actionable Fixes
1. **Rewrite review** to match actual progress: Python valuation helper exists; lease-analysis table partially populated; extractor & wrapper are planned for Sprint 5, not completed.
2. **Remove fabricated metrics** (investment totals, multiples, success rates) until real outputs exist.
3. **Create stubs or delete path references** (`src/…`, `scripts/analyze_leases.py`) to avoid confusion.
4. **Set realistic KPIs** for next sprint (e.g., “parse 3 leases automatically, generate Markdown table”).

## 3. Suggested Template for Honest Sprint-5 Review
```
# Sprint 5 Review – Foundation Work Only

• Implemented `lease_valuation.py` helper; tested manually on Illinois lease.
• Added 3 new lease PDFs and updated analysis table.
• Planned extractor & wrapper scripts for Sprint 6 (not yet coded).
• Repository cleanup: removed Excel artefacts, established .gitignore & LFS.
```
