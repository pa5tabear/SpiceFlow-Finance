# Sprint 2 Review - Excel NPV Calculator Development

*Honest assessment of sprint progress, challenges, and learnings*

**Sprint Goal**: Build working Excel NPV calculator using real Illinois Lanceleaf lease data  
**Duration**: 2 days  
**Status**: COMPLETED ‚úÖ  
**Date**: July 12, 2025

## What We Actually Accomplished

### ‚úÖ **Primary Goal Achieved**
- **Planned**: Functional Excel calculator with real data
- **Actual**: Working calculator tested against 3 real lease examples
- **Quality**: Proper NPV formulas, risk tiers, validation against industry benchmarks

### ‚úÖ **Files Successfully Created**
1. **`spiceflow-calculator-v1-improved.csv`** - Main Excel calculator (28 KB)
2. **`validation_results.csv`** - Test results from real lease data
3. **`create_calculator.py`** - Python generator script  
4. **`validate_calculator.py`** - Validation testing script
5. **`test-scenarios.csv`** - Test case templates
6. **`spiceflow-calculator-instructions.md`** - User documentation
7. **`sprint-2-deliverables.md`** - Complete sprint summary

### ‚úÖ **Calculator Features Implemented**
- **NPV calculation** with escalating cash flows (25-year projection)
- **Risk-based discount rates**: Low (8%), Medium (12%), High (16%)
- **Dynamic VLOOKUP** for automatic discount rate selection
- **Buyout offer calculation** (80% of NPV)
- **Industry benchmark comparison** (vs Renewa 12.5x standard)
- **Input validation** and error handling

## What We Did NOT Accomplish

### ‚ùå **No Advanced Excel Features**
- **Missing**: Dropdown data validation (manual risk tier entry required)
- **Missing**: Charts or visual cash flow timeline
- **Missing**: Sensitivity analysis tables
- **Impact**: Less user-friendly than planned, requires manual formula updates

### ‚ùå **No Professional Formatting**
- **Basic CSV format**: Not formatted for stakeholder presentations
- **No styling**: Plain text, no colors or professional layout
- **Manual process**: Risk tier changes require formula updates
- **Future need**: Excel-native file with proper formatting

### ‚ùå **Limited Competitiveness Analysis**
- **Surface-level benchmarking**: Only compared to Renewa 12.5x
- **Missing**: Analysis of why our offers are below market for smaller deals
- **No optimization**: Didn't adjust buyout percentages during sprint
- **Gap**: Need deeper market positioning strategy

## Key Insights Discovered

### üí° **Size Matters for Competitiveness**
- **Large deals work**: Wyoming ($230K annual) ‚Üí 9.4x multiple ‚úÖ competitive
- **Small deals struggle**: Illinois ($95K annual) ‚Üí 7.3x multiple ‚ö†Ô∏è below market
- **Business implication**: May need different pricing strategies by deal size
- **Root cause**: Fixed 80% NPV discount hits smaller deals harder

### üí° **Risk Assessment Impact is Significant**
- **8% vs 12% discount rate**: ~30% difference in NPV
- **Wyoming (Low risk)**: Competitive at 74.8% of Renewa benchmark
- **Illinois/Kentucky (Medium risk)**: Only 57-58% of Renewa benchmark
- **Strategy insight**: Risk tier assignment crucial for deal competitiveness

### üí° **Industry Benchmarks Provide Reality Check**
- **Renewa pays ~12.5x annual rent** consistently
- **Our range**: 7.2x-9.4x depending on risk and escalators
- **Market position**: Competitive on large/low-risk deals only
- **Adjustment needed**: Higher buyout percentages or lower discount rates

## Challenges Encountered

### üö´ **Excel Limitations in CSV Format**
- **Problem**: CSV doesn't support dropdown validation or advanced Excel features
- **Workaround**: Manual risk tier entry with VLOOKUP formulas
- **Process impact**: More error-prone, requires user training
- **Solution for Sprint 3**: Create native Excel file with proper features

### üö´ **Formula Complexity**
- **Challenge**: Dynamic discount rate lookup across 25 years of cash flows
- **Solution**: VLOOKUP formulas in each present value calculation
- **Trade-off**: More complex but fully automated once risk tier is set
- **User impact**: Requires basic Excel knowledge to modify

### üö´ **Competitive Positioning Reality**
- **Discovery**: Our conservative approach yields uncompetitive offers
- **Market reality**: Renewa's 12.5x is the standard we must beat
- **Business challenge**: Need higher offers while maintaining profitability
- **Strategic question**: Are we being too risk-averse?

## Honest Self-Assessment

### üí™ **What Went Well**
- **Technical execution**: Calculator works correctly with real data
- **Validation process**: Systematic testing against 3 lease examples
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive instructions and deliverables summary
- **Foundation building**: Solid base for Sprint 3 enhancements

### ü§î **What Could Be Better**
- **Market competitiveness**: Offers too low for smaller deals
- **User experience**: CSV format requires manual formula updates
- **Analysis depth**: Didn't explore optimization during development
- **Stakeholder readiness**: Needs formatting for professional presentation

### üò¨ **Honest Concerns**
- **Business viability**: Can we be profitable at competitive rates?
- **Market positioning**: Are we entering from a weak position?
- **Scale economics**: Small deals may not be worth pursuing
- **Tool sophistication**: Calculator may seem basic to sophisticated stakeholders
