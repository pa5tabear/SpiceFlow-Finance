## üìä Key Insights

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- **Calculator functions correctly** with real lease data
- **NPV formulas accurate** with escalating cash flows
- **Risk tiers implemented** with appropriate discount rates
- **Wyoming example competitive** vs industry benchmarks

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement:
- **Buyout percentages too low** for smaller leases (7.2x-7.3x multiples)

- **Risk assessment** may be too conservative for some deals

### üí° Recommendations for Sprint 3:
1. **Adjust buyout percentage** from 80% to 85-90% of NPV
2. **Add minimum multiple** floor (e.g., 8x annual rent)
3. **Create deal quality tiers** with different offer structures
4. **Add sensitivity analysis** for different scenarios
